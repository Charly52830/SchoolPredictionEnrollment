This collaboration with the secretary of education of Zacatecas aims solve the school enrollment forecast problem for all the schools in Zacatecas. The proposed solution is based on artificial neural networks trained with the data from the Mexico 911 statistics and performs an accuracy of 11% over the current forecasting method for the first year of prediction.
